        <h2>Why Software Engineering?</h2>
        <p>
          As the first employee at a VC-backed startup, I quickly learned how
          tough it can be to turn <em>great ideas</em> into a successful
          product.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Head of Operations, I worked with a wide range of peopleâ€”from
          junior engineers to CEOs at tech startups around the world. These
          experiences taught me a lot about the tech industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realized how powerful coding can be, with the ability to impact
          millions of lives. As I explored longtermism and the world's biggest
          challenges, I knew that learning to code would be a key skill to help
          me make a real difference and build a meaningful career.

        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>
          Completing Flatiron School's coding bootcamp and Treehouse's Tech
          Degree both taught me a lot of fundamental programming concepts. I've
          applied these concepts (and more) by building projects and working on
          real-world applications.
